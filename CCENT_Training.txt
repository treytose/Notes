Terminology:
    NIC (Network Interface Card) - Computer hardware that connects a computer to a network.
        transforms computer data into a format that can be transported over a wire.
    Computer Network - Computers that are connected and capable of sharing information.
    Networking Protocols - Rules for directing internet traffic. Kind of like vehicle traffic has stop signs, traffic lights, etc.

Home Network:
    Router:     Moves information from one interface to another
                Make decisions to determine best path for information to travel based on distance or route cost
    Switch:     Connects multiple device together (PC, Printer, PC) -> Switch -> Router -> ...
    DNS (Domain Name System): Converts names or domain names to an IP address
    Network Characteristics: Similar to how computers have specs such as CPU, RAM, etc. Networks have Characteristics to determine things such as speed.

Logical V.S. Physical Topology
Logical: Desribes the path of which data is transferred in a network. May be very different than physical topology.
    May use VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) which can drastically change a network
Physical: The actual arrangment of a network. cables, network devices, endpoints, etc. Shows how the network appears.

########################### Section 7 - IP Addressing #####################
#### Overview ####
Address Classes:
    * Class A
        = Test case
    * Class B
    * Class C
    * Class D
    * Class E
    * CIDR

Special Addresses:
    * Loopback address
    * local broadcast address

Network Masks:
IPv4 Address:
    * A layer 3, network level, logical address assigned by an administrator
    * Used to identify specific devices on a network
    * connectionless protocol
        = unlike TCP, a connection protocol, IPv4 does not need a connection to transmit packets
    * packets treated independently
        = may take different paths due to routers load balancing, bandwidth, hopcount, etc.
    * hierarchical addressing structure
        = network and host portion
    * best effort delivery
        = packets may be lost
        = no data recovery features
        = relies on higher level protocols to implement data recovery (TCP)

IPv4 Address Format:
    * 192.168.254.37
        = Binary Conversion: 11000000.10101000.11111110.00100101
    * 32 bits total
    * 4 segments, each segment is 8 bits (aka octets)
    * Network Address Portion (Network ID):
        = identifies a specific network

Network Address V.S. Host Address:
    * Routers determine route based on destination given by the Network address
        = Routers have lookup tables in them that are full of network addresses
    * The host address is used to determine the device on the destination network

Address Classes:
    * Class A, B, C
        = Used for Unicast traffic
        = Recall that Unicast is single direction traffic e.g. A -> B
    * Class D
        = Used for multicast traffic
        = Recall multicast is for multiple direction traffic. e.g. A -> B,C
    * Class E
        = Reserved for future experimental purposes
    * IPv6 does NOT use address classes
    * !IPv4 address classes have been replaced by CIDR!
