assert args.length == 1 : "Wrong number of arguments"; //use java -ea <class> to enable assertions
//used for finding errors

//-----------------------debugger------------------------
//allows you to run a little bit of code at a time
//javac -g <class>.java  use this to compile it for debugging
//jdb <class>  			 use this to start debugging
//stop at <class>:10     will stop at line 10 
//print stringName       prints the string value
//step 					 moves to the next line
//cont					 will continue until it reaches a breakpoint
//set variableName = ... sets a variable to a certain value
//look up other jdb commands like: dump, where, stop in, etc.

//------------------------Test----------------------------
//Unit test - test the method of an object to see if it outputs the wanted results
//Test suite - runs many test at once
//Regression testing - re-test old code when changes are made
//include tests in main() or in a test() method OR a Test class
//------------example of creating a test-------
public int distance(int x, int x2)
{
	return x2-x1;
}
public static void main(string[] args)
{
	if(distance(10,5) == 5)
		System.out.println("distance method works correctly!");
	else
		System.out.println("distance method not working correctly!");
}
//-------------------------Recursion-------------------------
public static int sum(int sumTo)
{
	if(sumTo == 1) //base case
		return 1;
	else{
		return (sumTo + sum(sumTo - 1));
		
	}
}
//recursive statements have:
//Branching if statements
//Base cases: if the problem is small enough return the obvious answer
//Every execution must end in a base case
//recursive cases:
//	call the function again, on smaller input
//	computer with the answer in some way and return it
//-===========================Inheritance-=================================
//inheritance is just extending another class 
//it gets its variables and methods so long as they are declared public or protected 

//------------------Polymorphism-------------------------
@lookup javadoc comments
-promotes code reuse
-promotes code sharing

-object, person, student, undergrad
^ inheritance
an undergrad is a student,person,and an object
a student is a person, object. etc.
^polymorphism*

-casting up is okay, casting down is not!
Undergraduate u = new Undergraduate();
Student s = u;  //okay because an undergraduate IS also a student
Undergraduate u2 = s; //will NOT work..must cast (undergraduate)
Undergraduate u2 = (Undergraduate)s; // okay!

Student s = new Student();
Undergraduate u = s; //NOT okay because a student is NOT an undergraduate

undergrad --> student --> person --> object
student = (student)undergrad;
student = person;
undergrad = student;
object = (object)undergrad;

----------------------------------------------------
common to use super.method(); when overwriting in the subclass
super.super.method(); //NOT ALLOWED*

java's object class has the method toString();
so you can override toString(); (called everytime you print an object)
public String toString(){} //to override Object.toString();

-----------------Abstract classes-----------------
public abstract class Dog{
	public abstract int scoreAccordingToStandard();
}
//abstract means you cannot create a dog object
-abstact classes leave one or more methods undefined
-cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
-subclasses must implement each abstract method
-a class can only extend 1 abstract class, 
	-while it can implement multiple interfaces


public class Labrador extends Dog
{
	public int scoreAccordingToStandard(){}
}
//----------------------INTERFACES----------------------------
public Comparable arrayMaximum(Comparable[] arr)
{
	
}
