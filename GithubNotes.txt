----Creating a Repository----
Go onto your Github account and create a new repository. 
Initialize it with a READ_ME
Copy the URL for the repository
On the command prompt naviagate to the location you want to save the repository
git clone <URL> 			--creates the repository in the current directory
git status    				--Shows you what is different between the Github repos and your own files
git add <file name>			--adds any changes or new files

Now if you were to type git status --again it would show the files ready to be committed

git commit -m "Descriptive Message" --locks into the repository with a message of whats changed

now it's locked in but the Github repository still has not changed!!!

git push 					--will take the commits on your machine and PUSH it up to github

git pull 					--pulls the files from the github repos..only works if in the correct directory
							--most recent version of Master

git add -A 					--adds all your files

esc :wq  enter     				--if you accidently commit without a -m "message"

------------------------------------Branching, Merging, Pull Request----------------------------------------------
git branch 				--shows you all the branches in the repository and which branch you are on 
git branch <branchName> --copies the current branch to a new branch called whatever you call it
git checkout <branch>   --switches to the given branch
git merge <branch>      --merges the github branch with your branch
