----Creating a Repository----
Go onto your Github account and create a new repository. 
Initialize it with a READ_ME
Copy the URL for the repository
On the command prompt naviagate to the location you want to save the repository
git clone <URL> 			--creates the repository in the current directory
git status    				--Shows you what is different between the Github repos and your own files
git add <file name>			--adds any changes or new files

Now if you were to type git status --again it would show the files ready to be committed

git commit -m "Descriptive Message" --locks into the repository with a message of whats changed

now it's locked in but the Github repository still has not changed!!!

git push 					--will take the commits on your machine and PUSH it up to github
