Introduction & Welcome
########################### Section 2 & 3 #########################
Terminology:
    * NIC (Network Interface Card) - Computer hardware that connects a computer to a network.
        transforms computer data into a format that can be transported over a wire.
    * Computer Network - Computers that are connected and capable of sharing information.
    * Networking Protocols - Rules for directing internet traffic. Kind of like vehicle traffic has stop signs, traffic lights, etc.

Home Network:
    * Router    
		= Moves information from one interface to another
    	= Make decisions to determine best path for information to travel based on distance or route cost
    * Switch     
		= Connects multiple device together (PC, Printer, PC) -> Switch -> Router -> ...
    * DNS (Domain Name System) 
		= Converts names or domain names to an IP address
    * Network Characteristics
		= Similar to how computers have specs such as CPU, RAM, etc. Networks have Characteristics to determine things such as speed.

Logical V.S. Physical Topology:
	* Logical 
		= Desribes the path of which data is transferred in a network. May be very different than physical topology.
    	= May use VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) which can drastically change a network
	* Physical
		= The actual arrangment of a network. cables, network devices, endpoints, etc. Shows how the network appears.

######################## Section 4 OSI Model ########################
OSI Model uses layers so that different machines are still compatible e.g. A HP windows machine can connect to a CentOS server with no issues 

All People Sleeping Through Networking Dont Pass   (Jingle to remember OSI Layers)
Layers:
	Layer 1 - Physical
	Layer 2 - Datalink
	Layer 3 - Network
	Layer 4 - Transport 
	Layer 5 - Session
	Layer 6 - Presentation
	Layer 7 - Application
	
Advantages of using the OSI Model:
	- Standard and Inoperability
	- Split Development. e.g. I don't need to understand networking to develop a website
	
Developer Layers: 		5, 6, 7
Network Eng. Layers: 	1, 2, 3, 4

Layer 7 - Application Layer:
	* The Application Layer is the layer dealing with application protocols such as FTP, Telnet, HTTP
	* e.g. Microsoft Outlook uses protocols such as IMAP, POP3, and SMTP
	
Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:
	* Data Representation / Syntax
		= ensures data is receivable by receiving system
		= formats data to be presented to the application layer 
		= structures data
		= negotiates data transfer syntax for application layer 

Layer 5 - Session Layer:
	* Interhost Communication
		= establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions between applications 
		= two application processes on different machines can establish a session 
		
Layer 4 - Transport Layer:
	* End to End Connections
		= message segmentation
			@ splits message into smaller parts to be transported
		= handles transportation issues between hosts
		= ensures data transport reliability
		= establishes, maintains, and terminates virtual circuits 
	* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
		= if packet is missing, packet is retransmitted
		= Flow Control 
			@ manage data transmission
			@ Ensures the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving device can handle 
		= Session Multiplexing
			@ allows multiple message streams or sessions onto one logical link
	* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		= does not provide reliability
		= if packets are dropped then they are lost, packets are not retransmitted
		= lightweight, not as much overhead as TCP 
		= Used for things such as Live TV, VoIP (Voice over IP), etc.
		
Layer 3 - Network Layer:
	* Data Delivery
		= Routes data packets 
	* Layer 3 switches
		= have router capabilities 
		= uses protocols to select best path to deliver data 
			@ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
			@ BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
			@ IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
		= Path determination and logical addressing
	* IP protocols
		= IPv4
		= IPv6
	* Criteria for data delivery 
		= cost 
		= hop count 
		= bandwidth
			@ OSPF 
		= longest match of network address
	* Not concerned with reliability, leaves that to higher level protocols such as TCP in Layer 4

Layer 2 - Data Link Layer:
	* Access to media 
		= defines how data is formatted for transmission
		= defines how access to the network in controlled
		= provides Error detection that occurs at physical layer 
	* Ethernet
		= MAC Address (Media Access Control)
			@ MAC Address is used as the identifier of a device 
			@ 48 bits in length, 6 two-digit hexadecimal numbers, e.g. D8-CB-B8-1F-D7-63
			@ Broken into 2 parts 
				- Organization Unique Identifier (OUI)
				- Unique Portion
			@ Manufactured into a Network Card or NIC
		= Formatted according to rules of ethernet 
		= may traverse WAN Link that uses PPP (Point to Point Protocol)

Layer 1 - Physical Layer:
	* Binary Transmission
		= states represented by 0 or 1 

Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation:
	* User Data goes through a stairlike process when it is transmitted 
		= User sends data, it is then encapsulated by going through each layer header: L7 -> L6 -> L5 -> ... -> L1
		= Data gets to receiving end and is then de-encapsulated: L1 -> L2 -> ... -> L6 -> L7

Peer to Peer Communication	
	* Each layer in the OSI model only communicates with the equivalent layer.
	PC 1					  Data Type					PC 2
	___________________________________________________________________
	Application Layer _______________________________ Application Layer
	Presentation Layer ______________________________ Presentation Layer 
	Session Layer ___________________________________ Session Layer 
	Transport Layer _________Segments________________ Transport Layer 
	Network Layer ___________Packets_________________ Network Layer 
	Data Link Layer __________Frames_________________ Data Link Layer 
	Physical Layer ____________Bits__________________ Physical Layer 

Host Communication
	* Computer A may send different types of data in no specific order to computer B. 
		@ Computer A -> 3 Packets of TFTP, 2 Packets of Telnet, 5 Packets of TFTP -> Computer B 
		  Computer B may be running serveral several Layer 3 protocols (IPv4, IPv6)
		  How does computer B know if the traffic arriving at Layer 2 is IPv4 or IPv6?
		  	= The ethernet data has a type field, the NIC reads the type field and informs other layers of the type of data (IPv4 or IPv6) 

TCP/IP Model V.S. OSI Model 
OSI Model was not designed for TCP/IP so there is a simplified version of the OSI model called the TCP/IP model 

TCP/IP Model:
	Layer 4 - Application 
	Layer 3 - Transport 
	Layer 2 - Internet 
	Layer 1 - Network Access

##################################### Section 6 - Hexadecimal #####################################
Hexadecimal:
	* Base 16
	* 0-F, where F is equivalent to 15 in decimal

Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal:
	* convert the decimal number to binary
	* Split the binary number into segments of 4. This is because 4 binary numbers can be equal up to 15 which is the highest hexadecimal number
	* Convert to Hexadecimal
	* Example:
		= 128 (decimal)
		= 10000000 (binary)
		= 1000 | 0000  (equivalent to 8 | 0 in hexadecimal)
		= 80 (hexadecimal representation of 128)

Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal:
	* Convert each digit of hexadecimal to 4 digits of binary
	* Convert the binary to decimal 
	* Example:
		= 3A (Hexadecimal)
		= 0011 | 1010 (Binary, split)
		= 00111010 (Binary)
		= 58 (Decimal)

################################## Section 7 - IP Addressing #########################################
#### Overview ####
Address Classes:
    * Class A
		= 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
    * Class B
		= 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    * Class C
		= 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    * Class D
    * Class E
    * CIDR

Special Addresses:
    * Loopback address
    * local broadcast address

Network Masks:

#### IPv4 Address ####
A layer 3, network level, logical address assigned by an administrator~

Used to identify specific devices on a network

connectionless protocol:
	* unlike TCP, a connection protocol, IPv4 does not need a connection to transmit packets

packets treated independently:
	* may take different paths due to routers load balancing, bandwidth, hopcount, etc.

hierarchical addressing structure:
	* network and host portion

best effort delivery:
	* packets may be lost
	* no data recovery features
	* relies on higher level protocols to implement data recovery (TCP)

IPv4 Address Format:
    * 192.168.254.37
        = Binary Conversion: 11000000.10101000.11111110.00100101
    * 32 bits total
    * 4 segments, each segment is 8 bits (aka octets)
    * Network Address Portion (Network ID):
        = identifies a specific network

Network V.S. Host portion:
	* portion depends on the class of the address
		= e.g. Class A address, the first octet is the network & the last 3 octets are the host 
	* Network Address Portion (Network ID):
		= identifies a specific network 
		= routers maintain routing tables that contain the network 
		= look at destination of IP address and match to network address 
	* Host address portion (host ID):
		= identifies a specific endpoint on a network 
		= server, printers, PCs, IPhone, etc. 
		
#### Address Classes ####
Address Classes Overview:
Class A, B, C:
	* Used for Unicast traffic
	* Recall that Unicast is single direction traffic e.g. A -> B
Class D
	* Used for multicast traffic
	* Recall multicast is for multiple direction traffic. e.g. A -> B,C
Class E:
	* Reserved for future experimental purposes
IPv6 does NOT use address classes
!IPv4 address classes have been replaced by CIDR!

NOTE: Class A,B,C are used for Unicast traffic

Class A:
	* starts with a binary 0
		= First octet range: 00000000 (0) to 01111111 (127)
		= decimal range: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
	* Exceptions:
		= IPs starting with 127 are reserved for loopback-addresses~
		= 0.0.0.0 is reserved as the default network 
		= cannot assign 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 as device IP
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= The first octet is the Network portion
		= The last 3 octets are for the host 
		= e.g. 104.168.254.37, 104.0.0.0 would be the network address & 104.168.254.37 would be the host address

Class B:
	* starts with a binary 10
		= First octet range is from: 10000000 (128) to 10111111 (191)
		= decimal range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= The first 2 octets are the network portion 
		= The last 2 octets are the host portion
		= e.g. 128.168.254.37, 128.168.0.0 would be the network address & 128.168.254.37 would be the host address
	
Class C:
	* starts with binary 110
		= First octet range: 11000000 (192) to 11011111 (223)
		= decimal range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= First 3 octets are the Network portion 
		= Last octet is the host portion 
		= e.g. 192.168.254.37, 192.168.254.0 is the network address & 192.168.254.37 is the host address

Recall: Unicast~ is when 1 device talks to 1 device, Multicast~ is when 1 device talks to multiple devices

Class D:
	* used for multicast 
	* Starts with binary 1110:
		= first octet range is from: 11100000 (224) to 11101111 (239)
		= decimal range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
	* Exceptions:
		= OSPF routing protocol uses 224.0.0.5 & 224.0.0.6
		= 224.0.0.X are Link-Local-Multicasts~

Class E:
	* starts with binary 1111
		= first octet range is from: 11110000 (240) to 11111111 (255)
		= decimal range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
	* Class E is reserved for experimental purposes 

NOTE: These address classes have been replaced with CIDR!

#### Special Addresses ####
Local Loopback Addresses:
	* Address: 127.0.0.1
		= NOTE: Any 127.X.X.X address is considered loopback addresses (seen as a mistake, 16million addresses wasted)
	* used to let a system send a message to itself for testing 
	* useful to make sure that TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on machine

Local Broadcast Address:
	* Communicates with all devices on local network
	* entire address is binary 1s
		= 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 or 255.255.255.255
	* Example:
		= host boots up and doesn't have an IP address, nor does it know the IP address of the DHCP server 
		= host sends a local broadcast to request an IP address from the DHCP server 
	* Broadcasts are ALWAYS dropped by routers
		= UNLESS DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay is configured to forward the request to a DHCP server 

Directed Broadcast Address:
	* Host sends data to all devices on a specific network 
	* Entire host portion is binary 1s
	* e.g. if the Network is 172.31.0.0 (Class B Address)
		= Directed Broadcast address is: 172.31.255.255
	* Routers can be configured to route directed broadcast
		= Disabled by default (due to DoS attacks)
	* DoS attack:
		= Hacker wants to DoS IP 172.16.0.1
		= Hacker sends a ton of traffic to network 172.31.0.0 using a Directed Broadcast with source address being 172.16.0.1 (not the hackers actual IP)
		= The directed broadcast would be 172.31.255.255, hence all hosts on 172.31.0.0 would receive the broadcast 
		= All of the hosts would then reply to the source address, hence overwhelming the source address host creating a DoS attack 


#### RFC - Private Addressess ####
RFC (Request For Comments):
	* Internet standards
	* Newer RFCs may replace older RFCs

RFC1918:
	* Private IP Addresses
	* non-routable networks on the internet
		= 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (1 Class A network)
		= 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (16 class B networks)
		= 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (256 Class C networks)
	* implemented to increase the longevity of IPv4
	* in order for your computer with host IP 192.168.X.X to traverse the internet your IP must use NAT~ (Network Address Translated) to convert to a public address
		= NAT is done by your Router 

#### RFC - Link Local Addresses ####
RFC3927:
	* Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)
	* Used when a PC is configured for DHCP but no DHCP server is available
		= PC automatically chooses an IP in range 169.254.0.0/16
		= Allows two computers to communicate when no DHCP server is available
		
#### Network Masks ####
Network Address:
	* Used to determine network and host portion
	* is a device remote or local?

Network Masks:
	* allows us to determine the host and network portion of an address 
	* this lets us determine if the device we want to talk to is on:
		= A remote host (different subnet): can be reached via default gateway 
		= A local host (on the same subnet): can be reached without going through the default gateway
	* devices are on the same subnet if they are using a /16 mask!
	* devices are on different subnets if they are using a /24 mask!
	
Class A, B, and C networks have default masks AKA natural masks:
	* Class A: 255.0.0.0
	* Class B: 255.255.0.0
	* Class C: 255.255.255.0

Class A network that hasn't been subnetted:
	* Address/Mask pair:
		= 10.1.1.1 / 255.0.0.0
	* 1 in the mask means network 
	* 0 in the mask means host 
	* hence, with the mask 255.0.0.0 which is binary 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 means the network address portion is 10 which means network 10.0.0.0

Two Simple Rules!:
	* Any address bits with corresponding mask bits set to 1 represent the network ID 
	* Any address bits with corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the host ID 
	* Example:
		= You have an IP of 10.1.1.1 (class A address) and a Network Mask of 255.0.0.0
		= IP: 10.1.1.1 converts to 00001010.00000001.00000001.00000001
		= Network Mask: 255.0.0.0 converts to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
		= NetID: 00001010 or 10 
		= HostID: 00000001.00000001.00000001 or 1.1.1
	* Example 2:
		= You have an IP of 1.1.1.1 (Class A) and a Network Mask of 255.255.0.0
		= NetID: 1.1
		= HostID: .1.1
		= NOTICE: This is a class A address yet the Network mask determine the network portion to be the first two octets 

How to know if receiving device is Local or Remote?:
	* To check if other host is local:
		= Check network portion of address 
		= Compare to the other host
		= If they are the same network, the other device is local 
		= If they are NOT the same network, the other device is remote 

Discontiguous Network Mask:
	* CISCO does NOT support discontiguous masks!
	* Discontigous masks are network masks that have alternating 1s and 0s
		= Example of discontiguous mask: 11110000.11111111.00000110.1100000000 (240.255.3.191)
		= Example of contiguous mask: 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000 (255.240.0.0)


#### CIDR ####
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
	* Replaces classful IP Addressing 
	* Variable Length subnet masks (VLSM)
	* Changes network mask notation:
		= Instead of using 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
		= Use 10.0.0.0/8

CIDR Notation:
	* 10.0.0.0/8
	* The /8 means that there are 8 binary 1s in the network mask 
		= /8 would convert to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 or 255.0.0.0 (old notation)
		= This notation is possible since network masks are contiguous
		= Hence, 10.0.0.0/8 would mean the network portion would be the first octet which would be 10, and the host portion is .0.0.0
	* Another Example of CIDR notation:
		= Network mask 255.255.255.0 can be written as /24 since 255.255.255.0 is equal to 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 which is 24 consecutive binary 1s
		= So, 10.0.0.0/24 would have a network portion of 10.0.0 and a host portion of .0
		
CIDR Issues:
	* Class A:
		= supports 16,777,214 (or 2^24) host addresses 
		= Has default mask of 255.0.0.0
	* Class B:
		= supports 65536 (or 2^16) host addresses 
		= Has default mask of 255.255.0.0
	* Class C:
		= supports 254 (or 2^8) host addresses 
		= Default mask of 255.255.255.0

	* What if a company wants to support 3000 hosts?
		= Class B would be wasting thousands of hosts
		= Class C wouldn't be enough hosts 
	* CIDR allows you to have variable length subnet masks
		= e.g. with CIDR you can have a network mask of /11 or 255.224.0.0
		= This solves the issue described above as we can come closer to the amount of hosts we need to support without wasting thousands of host addresses
