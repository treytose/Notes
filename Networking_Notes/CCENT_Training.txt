Introduction & Welcome
########################### Section 2 & 3 #########################
Terminology:
    * NIC (Network Interface Card) - Computer hardware that connects a computer to a network.
        transforms computer data into a format that can be transported over a wire.
    * Computer Network - Computers that are connected and capable of sharing information.
    * Networking Protocols - Rules for directing internet traffic. Kind of like vehicle traffic has stop signs, traffic lights, etc.

Home Network:
    * Router    
		= Moves information from one interface to another
    	= Make decisions to determine best path for information to travel based on distance or route cost
    * Switch     
		= Connects multiple device together (PC, Printer, PC) -> Switch -> Router -> ...
    * DNS (Domain Name System) 
		= Converts names or domain names to an IP address
    * Network Characteristics
		= Similar to how computers have specs such as CPU, RAM, etc. Networks have Characteristics to determine things such as speed.

Logical V.S. Physical Topology:
	* Logical 
		= Desribes the path of which data is transferred in a network. May be very different than physical topology.
    	= May use VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) which can drastically change a network
	* Physical
		= The actual arrangment of a network. cables, network devices, endpoints, etc. Shows how the network appears.

######################## Section 4 OSI Model ########################
OSI Model uses layers so that different machines are still compatible e.g. A HP windows machine can connect to a CentOS server with no issues 

All People Sleeping Through Networking Dont Pass   (Jingle to remember OSI Layers)
Layers:
	Layer 1 - Physical
	Layer 2 - Datalink
	Layer 3 - Network
	Layer 4 - Transport 
	Layer 5 - Session
	Layer 6 - Presentation
	Layer 7 - Application
	
Advantages of using the OSI Model:
	- Standard and Inoperability
	- Split Development. e.g. I don't need to understand networking to develop a website
	
Developer Layers: 		5, 6, 7
Network Eng. Layers: 	1, 2, 3, 4

Layer 7 - Application Layer:
	* The Application Layer is the layer dealing with application protocols such as FTP, Telnet, HTTP
	* e.g. Microsoft Outlook uses protocols such as IMAP, POP3, and SMTP
	
Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:
	* Data Representation / Syntax
		= ensures data is receivable by receiving system
		= formats data to be presented to the application layer 
		= structures data
		= negotiates data transfer syntax for application layer 

Layer 5 - Session Layer:
	* Interhost Communication
		= establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions between applications 
		= two application processes on different machines can establish a session 
		
Layer 4 - Transport Layer:
	* End to End Connections
		= message segmentation
			@ splits message into smaller parts to be transported
		= handles transportation issues between hosts
		= ensures data transport reliability
		= establishes, maintains, and terminates virtual circuits 
	* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
		= if packet is missing, packet is retransmitted
		= Flow Control 
			@ manage data transmission
			@ Ensures the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving device can handle 
		= Session Multiplexing
			@ allows multiple message streams or sessions onto one logical link
	* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		= does not provide reliability
		= if packets are dropped then they are lost, packets are not retransmitted
		= lightweight, not as much overhead as TCP 
		= Used for things such as Live TV, VoIP (Voice over IP), etc.
		
Layer 3 - Network Layer:
	* Data Delivery
		= Routes data packets 
	* Layer 3 switches
		= have router capabilities 
		= uses protocols to select best path to deliver data 
			@ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
			@ BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
			@ IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
		= Path determination and logical addressing
	* IP protocols
		= IPv4
		= IPv6
	* Criteria for data delivery 
		= cost 
		= hop count 
		= bandwidth
			@ OSPF 
		= longest match of network address
	* Not concerned with reliability, leaves that to higher level protocols such as TCP in Layer 4

Layer 2 - Data Link Layer:
	* Access to media 
		= defines how data is formatted for transmission
		= defines how access to the network in controlled
		= provides Error detection that occurs at physical layer 
	* Ethernet
		= MAC Address (Media Access Control)
			@ MAC Address is used as the identifier of a device 
			@ 48 bits in length, 6 two-digit hexadecimal numbers, e.g. D8-CB-B8-1F-D7-63
			@ Broken into 2 parts 
				- Organization Unique Identifier (OUI)
				- Unique Portion
			@ Manufactured into a Network Card or NIC
		= Formatted according to rules of ethernet 
		= may traverse WAN Link that uses PPP (Point to Point Protocol)

Layer 1 - Physical Layer:
	* Binary Transmission
		= states represented by 0 or 1 

Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation:
	* User Data goes through a stairlike process when it is transmitted 
		= User sends data, it is then encapsulated by going through each layer header: L7 -> L6 -> L5 -> ... -> L1
		= Data gets to receiving end and is then de-encapsulated: L1 -> L2 -> ... -> L6 -> L7

Peer to Peer Communication	
	* Each layer in the OSI model only communicates with the equivalent layer.
	PC 1					  Data Type					PC 2
	___________________________________________________________________
	Application Layer _______________________________ Application Layer
	Presentation Layer ______________________________ Presentation Layer 
	Session Layer ___________________________________ Session Layer 
	Transport Layer _________Segments________________ Transport Layer 
	Network Layer ___________Packets_________________ Network Layer 
	Data Link Layer __________Frames_________________ Data Link Layer 
	Physical Layer ____________Bits__________________ Physical Layer 

Host Communication
	* Computer A may send different types of data in no specific order to computer B. 
		@ Computer A -> 3 Packets of TFTP, 2 Packets of Telnet, 5 Packets of TFTP -> Computer B 
		  Computer B may be running serveral several Layer 3 protocols (IPv4, IPv6)
		  How does computer B know if the traffic arriving at Layer 2 is IPv4 or IPv6?
		  	= The ethernet data has a type field, the NIC reads the type field and informs other layers of the type of data (IPv4 or IPv6) 

TCP/IP Model V.S. OSI Model 
OSI Model was not designed for TCP/IP so there is a simplified version of the OSI model called the TCP/IP model 

TCP/IP Model:
	Layer 4 - Application 
	Layer 3 - Transport 
	Layer 2 - Internet 
	Layer 1 - Network Access

##################################### Section 6 - Hexadecimal #####################################
Hexadecimal:
	* Base 16
	* 0-F, where F is equivalent to 15 in decimal

Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal:
	* convert the decimal number to binary
	* Split the binary number into segments of 4. This is because 4 binary numbers can be equal up to 15 which is the highest hexadecimal number
	* Convert to Hexadecimal
	* Example:
		= 128 (decimal)
		= 10000000 (binary)
		= 1000 | 0000  (equivalent to 8 | 0 in hexadecimal)
		= 80 (hexadecimal representation of 128)

Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal:
	* Convert each digit of hexadecimal to 4 digits of binary
	* Convert the binary to decimal 
	* Example:
		= 3A (Hexadecimal)
		= 0011 | 1010 (Binary, split)
		= 00111010 (Binary)
		= 58 (Decimal)

################################## Section 7 - IP Addressing #########################################
#### Overview ####
Address Classes:
    * Class A
		= 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
    * Class B
		= 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    * Class C
		= 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
    * Class D
    * Class E
    * CIDR

Special Addresses:
    * Loopback address
    * local broadcast address

Network Masks:

#### IPv4 Address ####
A layer 3, network level, logical address assigned by an administrator~

Used to identify specific devices on a network

connectionless protocol:
	* unlike TCP, a connection protocol, IPv4 does not need a connection to transmit packets

packets treated independently:
	* may take different paths due to routers load balancing, bandwidth, hopcount, etc.

hierarchical addressing structure:
	* network and host portion

best effort delivery:
	* packets may be lost
	* no data recovery features
	* relies on higher level protocols to implement data recovery (TCP)

IPv4 Address Format:
    * 192.168.254.37
        = Binary Conversion: 11000000.10101000.11111110.00100101
    * 32 bits total
    * 4 segments, each segment is 8 bits (aka octets)
    * Network Address Portion (Network ID):
        = identifies a specific network

Network V.S. Host portion:
	* portion depends on the class of the address
		= e.g. Class A address, the first octet is the network & the last 3 octets are the host 
	* Network Address Portion (Network ID):
		= identifies a specific network 
		= routers maintain routing tables that contain the network 
		= look at destination of IP address and match to network address 
	* Host address portion (host ID):
		= identifies a specific endpoint on a network 
		= server, printers, PCs, IPhone, etc. 
		
#### Address Classes ####
Address Classes Overview:
Class A, B, C:
	* Used for Unicast traffic
	* Recall that Unicast is single direction traffic e.g. A -> B
Class D
	* Used for multicast traffic
	* Recall multicast is for multiple direction traffic. e.g. A -> B,C
Class E:
	* Reserved for future experimental purposes
IPv6 does NOT use address classes
!IPv4 address classes have been replaced by CIDR!

NOTE: Class A,B,C are used for Unicast traffic

Class A:
	* starts with a binary 0
		= First octet range: 00000000 (0) to 01111111 (127)
		= decimal range: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
	* Exceptions:
		= IPs starting with 127 are reserved for loopback-addresses~
		= 0.0.0.0 is reserved as the default network 
		= cannot assign 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 as device IP
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= The first octet is the Network portion
		= The last 3 octets are for the host 
		= e.g. 104.168.254.37, 104.0.0.0 would be the network address & 104.168.254.37 would be the host address

Class B:
	* starts with a binary 10
		= First octet range is from: 10000000 (128) to 10111111 (191)
		= decimal range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= The first 2 octets are the network portion 
		= The last 2 octets are the host portion
		= e.g. 128.168.254.37, 128.168.0.0 would be the network address & 128.168.254.37 would be the host address
	
Class C:
	* starts with binary 110
		= First octet range: 11000000 (192) to 11011111 (223)
		= decimal range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
	* Network & Host Portion:
		= First 3 octets are the Network portion 
		= Last octet is the host portion 
		= e.g. 192.168.254.37, 192.168.254.0 is the network address & 192.168.254.37 is the host address

Recall: Unicast~ is when 1 device talks to 1 device, Multicast~ is when 1 device talks to multiple devices

Class D:
	* used for multicast 
	* Starts with binary 1110:
		= first octet range is from: 11100000 (224) to 11101111 (239)
		= decimal range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
	* Exceptions:
		= OSPF routing protocol uses 224.0.0.5 & 224.0.0.6
		= 224.0.0.X are Link-Local-Multicasts~

Class E:
	* starts with binary 1111
		= first octet range is from: 11110000 (240) to 11111111 (255)
		= decimal range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
	* Class E is reserved for experimental purposes 

NOTE: These address classes have been replaced with CIDR!

#### Special Addresses ####
Local Loopback Addresses:
	* Address: 127.0.0.1
		= NOTE: Any 127.X.X.X address is considered loopback addresses (seen as a mistake, 16million addresses wasted)
	* used to let a system send a message to itself for testing 
	* useful to make sure that TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on machine

Local Broadcast Address:
	* Communicates with all devices on local network
	* entire address is binary 1s
		= 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 or 255.255.255.255
	* Example:
		= host boots up and doesn't have an IP address, nor does it know the IP address of the DHCP server 
		= host sends a local broadcast to request an IP address from the DHCP server 
	* Broadcasts are ALWAYS dropped by routers
		= UNLESS DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay is configured to forward the request to a DHCP server 

Directed Broadcast Address:
	* Host sends data to all devices on a specific network 
	* Entire host portion is binary 1s
	* e.g. if the Network is 172.31.0.0 (Class B Address)
		= Directed Broadcast address is: 172.31.255.255
	* Routers can be configured to route directed broadcast
		= Disabled by default (due to DoS attacks)
	* DoS attack:
		= Hacker wants to DoS IP 172.16.0.1
		= Hacker sends a ton of traffic to network 172.31.0.0 using a Directed Broadcast with source address being 172.16.0.1 (not the hackers actual IP)
		= The directed broadcast would be 172.31.255.255, hence all hosts on 172.31.0.0 would receive the broadcast 
		= All of the hosts would then reply to the source address, hence overwhelming the source address host creating a DoS attack 


#### RFC - Private Addressess ####
RFC (Request For Comments):
	* Internet standards
	* Newer RFCs may replace older RFCs

RFC1918:
	* Private IP Addresses
	* non-routable networks on the internet
		= 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (1 Class A network)
		= 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (16 class B networks)
		= 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (256 Class C networks)
	* implemented to increase the longevity of IPv4
	* in order for your computer with host IP 192.168.X.X to traverse the internet your IP must use NAT~ (Network Address Translated) to convert to a public address
		= NAT is done by your Router 

#### RFC - Link Local Addresses ####
RFC3927:
	* Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)
	* Used when a PC is configured for DHCP but no DHCP server is available
		= PC automatically chooses an IP in range 169.254.0.0/16
		= Allows two computers to communicate when no DHCP server is available
		
#### Network Masks ####
Network Address:
	* Used to determine network and host portion
	* is a device remote or local?

Network Masks:
	* allows us to determine the host and network portion of an address 
	* this lets us determine if the device we want to talk to is on:
		= A remote host (different subnet): can be reached via default gateway 
		= A local host (on the same subnet): can be reached without going through the default gateway
	* devices are on the same subnet if they are using a /16 mask!
	* devices are on different subnets if they are using a /24 mask!
	
Class A, B, and C networks have default masks AKA natural masks:
	* Class A: 255.0.0.0
	* Class B: 255.255.0.0
	* Class C: 255.255.255.0

Class A network that hasn't been subnetted:
	* Address/Mask pair:
		= 10.1.1.1 / 255.0.0.0
	* 1 in the mask means network 
	* 0 in the mask means host 
	* hence, with the mask 255.0.0.0 which is binary 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 means the network address portion is 10 which means network 10.0.0.0

Two Simple Rules!:
	* Any address bits with corresponding mask bits set to 1 represent the network ID 
	* Any address bits with corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the host ID 
	* Example:
		= You have an IP of 10.1.1.1 (class A address) and a Network Mask of 255.0.0.0
		= IP: 10.1.1.1 converts to 00001010.00000001.00000001.00000001
		= Network Mask: 255.0.0.0 converts to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
		= NetID: 00001010 or 10 
		= HostID: 00000001.00000001.00000001 or 1.1.1
	* Example 2:
		= You have an IP of 1.1.1.1 (Class A) and a Network Mask of 255.255.0.0
		= NetID: 1.1
		= HostID: .1.1
		= NOTICE: This is a class A address yet the Network mask determine the network portion to be the first two octets 

How to know if receiving device is Local or Remote?:
	* To check if other host is local:
		= Check network portion of address 
		= Compare to the other host
		= If they are the same network, the other device is local 
		= If they are NOT the same network, the other device is remote 

Discontiguous Network Mask:
	* CISCO does NOT support discontiguous masks!
	* Discontigous masks are network masks that have alternating 1s and 0s
		= Example of discontiguous mask: 11110000.11111111.00000110.1100000000 (240.255.3.191)
		= Example of contiguous mask: 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000 (255.240.0.0)


#### CIDR ####
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
	* Replaces classful IP Addressing 
	* Variable Length subnet masks (VLSM)
	* Changes network mask notation:
		= Instead of using 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
		= Use 10.0.0.0/8

CIDR Notation:
	* 10.0.0.0/8
	* The /8 means that there are 8 binary 1s in the network mask 
		= /8 would convert to 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 or 255.0.0.0 (old notation)
		= This notation is possible since network masks are contiguous
		= Hence, 10.0.0.0/8 would mean the network portion would be the first octet which would be 10, and the host portion is .0.0.0
	* Another Example of CIDR notation:
		= Network mask 255.255.255.0 can be written as /24 since 255.255.255.0 is equal to 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 which is 24 consecutive binary 1s
		= So, 10.0.0.0/24 would have a network portion of 10.0.0 and a host portion of .0
		
CIDR Issues:
	* Class A:
		= supports 16,777,214 (or 2^24) host addresses 
		= Has default mask of 255.0.0.0
	* Class B:
		= supports 65536 (or 2^16) host addresses 
		= Has default mask of 255.255.0.0
	* Class C:
		= supports 254 (or 2^8) host addresses 
		= Default mask of 255.255.255.0

	* What if a company wants to support 3000 hosts?
		= Class B would be wasting thousands of hosts
		= Class C wouldn't be enough hosts 
	* CIDR allows you to have variable length subnet masks
		= e.g. with CIDR you can have a network mask of /11 or 255.224.0.0
		= This solves the issue described above as we can come closer to the amount of hosts we need to support without wasting thousands of host addresses

########################################### IP Subnetting #################################################
Subnetting Answers questions such as:
	* what subnet is this host on?
	* what is a last host? 
	* subnet  this  network into 10 subnets
	* what IP address would router1 be configured with if it is to use the first ip address in the same subnet as PC1?
2 Methods:
	* method 1 - binary 
	* method 2 - quick method 

#### Binary Method #### 
Network/Subnet Address: 
	* Fill the host portion of the address with 0s
	* AKA all host is 0!

Broadcast Address:
	* fill the host portion of the address with 1s 
	* AKA all host is 1!

First Host:
	* Fill the host portion of an address with binary 0s except for the last bit~ which is set to binary 1
	* AKA 1 above the subnet address!

Last Host:
	* Fill the host portion of an address with binary 1s except for the last bit~ which is set to binary 0 
	* AKA 1 below the broadcast address 

Example: 
	* Given an IP Address of 192.168.1.18/24 (aka 192.168.1.18 with Network Mask 255.255.255.0)
	* Network portion is 192.168.1
	* .18 is the host portion 
	* Subnet is 192.168.1.00000000
	* Broadcast Address 192.168.1.11111111 which is 192.168.1.255
	* 1st host is 192.168.1.00000001 which is 192.168.1.1 
	* last host is 192.168.1.11111110 which is 192.168.1.254

Example 2:
	* IP: 172.16.35.123/20
		= Same as 172.16.35.123 with netmask of 255.255.11110000.000000000 = 255.255.240.0

#### Fast Method ####
Table:
	128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1
	128 | 192 | 224 | 240 | 248 | 252 | 254 | 255 
Example:
	172.16.35.123/20
Step 1:
	* Convert /20 to network mask 
		= /20 -> 255.255.11110000.00000000 -> 255.255.240.0

Step 2:
	* Find corresponding number in table (or subtract from 256)
		= 256 - 240 = 16
		= This means that the subnet increases by increments of 16!

Step 3:
	* Find the factor of 16 that is below the 3rd octet of the IP 
		= 3rd octet is 35
		= 32~ is factor of 16 below 35

Hence the subnet is:
	* 172.16.32.0
	* NOTE: The next subnet would be +16 which is 172.16.48.0

Step 4:
	* The broadcast address is equal to the next subnet - 1
	* We add the subnet increment to the first subnet address corresponding octet to get the next subnet address 
		= 172.16.32.0 -> +16 -> 172.16.48.0
	* Now subtract 1 from the ~entire address~ to get the broadcast address! 
		= 172.16.47.0

#### Leased Lines #####
Leased lines only define Layer 1 services:
	* since they only define layer 1, companies use Layer 2 Protocols of HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) and PPP (Point to Point Protocol)

Recall: Layer 2 (Data Link) protocols always define how to control the delivery of data over a physical link of a particular type

HDLC:
	* Layer 2 Protocol 
	* When a router sends an HDLC frame, it can go only one place: to the other end of the link. 
	* HDLC has an address field but the destination is already implied (only 1 place to go)
	
PoP:
	* Point of Precense for a Service Provider 

EoMPLS:
	* Ethernet over Multi-Protocol Label Switching
	* This protocol allows us to view a WAN as a simple ethernet connection between two routers 
	* e.g. cust1 <--> Router A <--> (WAN using EoMPLS) <--> Router B <--> cust2

DSL:
	* Process of using telephone lines to provide internet
	* Digital Subscriber Line 
	* another WAN technology, creates short high-speed WAN between customer and ISP
	* Uses the already existing phone line for providing internet 
	* Uses RJ-11 connectors (smaller version of ethernet cable aka RJ-45 connector)
	* Consumers need a ~Modem~ to be able to connect to the internet via Phone Lines 

	* DSLAM
		= DSL Access MultiPlexer 
		= Allows the in home Router to be able to send data to/form the internet.
		= Basically splits internet traffic and voice telephone traffic 

	* DSL supports ~Assymetric Speeds~ which means download speeds are much faster than upload speeds 

Cable:
	* process of using TV Cable lines to provide internet 
	* creates an internet access services which has many similarities to DSL. 
	* like DSL, takes advantage of existing cabling.
	* like DSL, uses Assymetric speeds hence download is much faster than upload 
	* uses a special "Cable Modem"
	* connects using a ~coaxial cable~ 
	* generally a bit faster than DSL

### IP Routing ###

A host determines where to send a packet depending on its destination address:
	* If the destination is not within the same LAN, it sends the packet to its default gateway (router)

### R1 and R2s Logic - Routing Data Across the Network ####
Routers Keep an IP Routing Table:
	* Lists IP address groupings called IP networks~ and IP subnets~ 
	* Router receives a packet and compares the packet's destination IP address to the entries in the routing table !
		= The IP Routing Table tells the router where to forward the packet too 
	* Think of routers as a freeway with a bunch of signs telling packets (cars) where to go to reach their destination 

#### R3's Logic - Delivering Data to the End Destination ####
	* If the routers destination is the actual host and not another router the protocol changes (LAN v.s. WAN) 
	* Discussed below 

#### How Network Layer Routing Uses LANs and WANs ####
Layer 3 protocols focus only on logical pathing e.g. device A needs to get to device B
Layer 3 leaves the details to layer 2 data link layer. 

Example:
	* Host A -> Encapsulates an IP Packet with Ethernet -> Sends to default gateway
	* Default Gateway -> extracts the IP Packet and encapsulates it with HDLC header/trailer for WAN transport over HDLC 
	* Router 2 -> extracts the IP Packet and encapsulates it with ethetnet header/trailer 
	* Router 3 - extracts IP packet and encapsulates in a new ethernet header/trailer 
	* Host B -> Receives and extracts the IP Packet 


ARP:
	* Router may know the destination IP address but it doesn't know how to format the Layer 2 Header if the destination device MAC Address insn't in the routing table. !
	* Address Resolution Protocol 
	* Used for dynamically learning the data-link address of an IP host connected to a lan! 
	* e.g. A router doesn't know the MAC Address of where to send a packet so it sends an ARP request 
		= ARP -> Who has the IP of 192.168.254.37? -> Host B gets the request and says "I do! Here's my MAC Address!" -> Router now knows where to forward packets for the given IP 


#### IP Addressing and How Addressing Helps IP Routing ####
TCP/IP groups IP addresses together:
	* this is done because now addresses on the same physical network are part of the same group
	* These groups are called an IP Network~ or an IP Subnet~!
	* This is useful because now routing tables only need to store the the subnet location not every single IP Address 
	* e.g. a postal services knows to send all 73762 mail to okarche and doesn't care which specific address in okarche, okarche will handle that. 


#### Rules for IP Addresses ####
IPv4 Addresses:
	* consist of a 32-bit number (4 bytes or 4 octets)

NOTE: It isn't your computer that has an IP Address but your NIC (Network Interface Card)
			hence if you have a wireless NIC and an ethernet NIC then your computer has 2 IP Addresses 
			Similarily a router with multiple interfaces has multiple IP Addresses 

#### Class A, B, and C IPv4 Networks ####
Class A:
	* All IP Addresses that start with 1-126 

Class B:
	* All IP Addresses that start with 128 - 191

Class C:
	* All IP Addresses that start with 192 - 223

Class A,B,C define Unicast Addresses 

Class D:
	* defines multicast addresses 
	* All IP Addresses from 224-239

Class E:
	* originally reserved for experimental use but are now just reserved for future use 
	* All IP Addresses from 240-255

##### IPv4 Routing ####
IPv4 Host Routing:
	* Hosts use 2 step logic when deciding where to send a packet (assuming that the network design uses subnetting)
	* Step 1 - if the destination IP address is in the same IP subnet, send the packet directly to that destination host!
	* Step 2 - else send the packet to the default gateway!


IPv4 Router Forwarding Decisions:
	* Router receives data-link frame 
	* router checks the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) field to ensure that the frame has no errors; if errors occured discard the frame 
	* router extracts the IP packet and discards the data-link header/trailer 
	* compare the IP packet's destination address to the routing table and find the best route matching the IP address.
	* encapsulate the IP packet insade a new data-link header and trailer that matches the outgoing interface and forward the frame 

Routing Table:
	* each router adds a route, for each connected subnet, into its routing table 
	* routers use the routing protocol to tell its neighbors about the routes in its routing table 
	* after learning a new route from a neight, the router adds the route to its IP routing table

############################################# Chapter 7 - Ethernet LAN Switching ###########################
Overview of Switching Logic:
	* LAN switches ultimate goal is to forward ~ethernet frame~ to the correct destination MAC address. 
	* It makes decisions on where to send the frame based on the source AND destination MAC address in the ethernet frame header. 

	* A switch either forwards the frame or discards the frame (filtering)

Forwarding Known Unicast Frames:
	* Switches compare destination MAC addresses to their MAC Address table to decide where to forward a frame or ignore it! 
	* A switches MAC address table links a MAC address to an interface on the switch.
		= e.g. The MAC address table has made the link of MAC Address 0200.3333.3333 to interface G0/1
		= It made this link dynamically because it has received data from 0200.3333.3333 from interface G0/1
		=	An ethernet frame with ~destination~ MAC of 0200.3333.3333 now knows to be send through the interface G0/1 and no other interfaces 

How Switches Learn MAC Addresses:
	* switches listen to incoming ethernet frames and examine the ~source MAC~ address~
	* “The source is MAC 0200.1111.1111, the frame entered F0/1, so from my
		perspective, 0200.1111.1111 must be reachable out my port F0/1.”

	
Flooding Unknown Unicast and Broadcast Frames:
	* When the switch doesn't know where to send the received frame, it ~floods~ the switch meaning it sends the frame out of all of its interfaces except the one it received the frame from. 
	* switches also ~flood~ broadcast frames (frames with destination address of FFFF-FFFF-FFFF)	


Avoiding Loops with STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):
	* Switches prevent packets from looping by using STP 
	* STP!
		= Blocks some ports from forwarding frames sso that only one active path exists between a pair of LANs 
		= Prevents frames from infinitely looping 
		= Switches turn of a subset of interfaces and prevent them from receiving/forwarding. This prevents looping 

NOTE: If a switch receives a known unicast frame but the forwarding interface is the same as the receiving interface, then the switch discards the frame. 

VLAN and Switching:
	* switches only forward frames within the same VLAN 
		= e.g. if an interface G0/1 is on VLAN 1 then it will only forward the frame through another interface within VLAN 1 




############################### Chapter 8 - Configuring Basic Switch Management ##############################################
### Securing User Mode and Privileged Mode with Simple Passwords ###

Setup Enable Mode Password:
	* enter global config mode (conf t)
	* enter command ~enable ~secret <password> 

Setup Password for Console Access:
	* Note that this includes user level access to the console 
	* enter global config mode (conf t)
	* enter command ~line ~console ~0 
		= This enters config mode the console 
	* enter command ~password <password>~
	* enter command ~login~ to enable password requirement 


Setup Password for Telnet:
	* ~configure terminal~
	* ~line vty 0 15
	* ~password <password>
	* ~login 

Setup SHH:
	* NOTE SSH requires a username to be setup 
	* SSH is much more secure than Telnet since Telnet communicate over plain text 
	* conf t -> line vty 0 15 -> username <un> secret <pass> -> line vty 0 15 -> login local 


### Setting up and IPv4 for a switch ###

Switches need an IPv4 address to use things such as SSH and SNMP 

Switches don't have a physical NIC (network interface card) like computers. Instead they use things called SVI! (Switch Virtual Interface) aka VLAN:
	* The SVI acts like a virtual interface allowing the switch to have an IP address 

Configured the IP address of your VLAN:
	* conf t 
	* interface vlan 1 
	* ip address <ip> <subnet> 
		= e.g. ip address 192.168.254.38 255.255.255.128
	* no shutdown !
		= ~no shutdown~ enables an interface 
		= use ~shutdown~ to disable an interface 
	* back in conf t 
	* ip default-gateway <ip> 
		= set the IP of the default gateway for your switch 

Using DHCP to to dynamically set IPv4 settings on a switch:
	* you must tell the switch to use DHCP on an interface and then enable the interface (no shutdown) 
	* conf t 
	* interface vlan 1 
	* ip address dhcp 
	* no shutdown 



############################### Chapter 9 - Configuring Switch Interfaces #######################################
Duplex System:
	* used in point-to-point systems
	* used to allow two or more devices to communicate back and forth with eachother	

Full Duplex:
	* both parties can communicate with eachother at the same time !
	* Think of it as a phone conversation where both users may speak and hear at the same time 

Half Duplex:
	* both parties can communicate with eachother but not at the same time! 
	* Think of it as a walkie talkie system where only one user may speak at a time 


NOTE: Show all interface status using ~show interface~ status~ 


### Autonegotiation under working conditions ### 
Ethernet devices must use the same standard or they cannot correctly send data: 
	* a NIC with 100BASE-T which uses a UTP cable with a 100-Mbps speed cannot connect to a NIC with 1000BASE-T 
		= one end sending 100 Mbps and the other end trying to receive 1000 Mbps does NOT work! 
	* This creates an issue that if you upgrade your PC from 100Mbps NIC to a 1000Mbps then the switch must be upgraded which causes a huge chain reaction of upgrade requirements 
		= This problem is solved by using IEEE auto negotiation which automatically configures the NIC speed !
	* NIC by default chooses the fastest speed and full duplex over half duplex
