-------------- TCP v.s. UDP ----------------

-------------- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) --------------------
Vocabulary:
	SNMP - Protocol for communicating between SNMP enabled devices.
	
	SNMP Manager (NMS) - Software installed on a machine that polls the devices on your network.
		Has credentials for accessing info on agents.
		Compiles said info. into readable format used for diagnostics and troubleshooting
		(Optional) May contain system for notifying of issues via email or text
		When this software is combined with a machine it is called an NMS (Network Management System)
		
	SNMP Agents - A piece of software that is bundled with a network device.
		Compiles and stores all the data given from the device into an MIB database.
		
	SNMP Port - The manager polls the devices via Port UDP 161.
		SNMP traps are sent from the agent to the manager via Port UDP 162.
		UDP is most common for SNMP but TCP may be used as well.
	
	Managed Network Device -  Includes routers, switches, wifi, servers, PCs, Printers, USPs etc.
		Have SNMP enabled and properly configured to allowing polling by the NMS. 
		
	MIBs (Management Information Base) - Files containing a set of "questions" that the NMS can ask.
		The agents collect data and store it as defined in the MIB. 
		MIBs contain a set of values for statistics as well as for control of the device 
		Example flow:
			NMS asks agent a question -> Agent returns the answer 
		
	OIDs (Object Identifier) - A number created by the MIB of an agent. 
		Each OID is unique to an agent. 
		The OID is known by the NMS and is used to access an agent and it object of interest to retrieve info. 
		2 Types of OIDs:
			1. Scalar OID - Single Object Instance is like the vendor name of a device, there is only one.
			2. Tabular OID - Has multiple results for its OID, like a quad core CPU has 4 different CPU values
		Example OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1    .3        .0
					 [  -- MIB -- ] [Object] [Instance]
	SNMP Traps - When the device needs to alert the NMS of an event without being polled.
		Managed Netword Devices have Trap MIBs which have pre-defined conditions built in. 
		The NMS must have the Trap MIBs compiled so that it may recieve the Traps sent by the device.
		
	
What does SNMP do?
	- Monitors inbound and outbound traffic flow through a device 
	- Early detection of faults within a network device via alert/notifications
	- Analyze long term data to find bottle necks and performance issues 
	- Ability to remotely configure compatible devices 
	- Access and control devices via SNMP 
	
Versions of SNMP:
	SNMPv1 	- Low security
	SNMPv2c - Meh security, based on community strings 
	SNMPv3 	- User based security

**** SNMP Commands for Centos7 ****
snmpwalk
cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf    // Gives you the SNMP info for this device, enabled? version? etc. 
snmpwalk 					// Get list of command options 

snmpwalk -v <version> -c  <com_string> <host>	 
	<version> - the SNMP version e.g. 2c
	<com_string> - the community string password, found in snmp.conf 
	<host> - The hostname for the device to do the walk on. e.g. "localhost" to snmp walk itself
	
snmpwalk <...> -O <options> <host>
	options - Allows you to enter various options for the snmpwalk such as print only numbers etc. 
	
snmpwalk <...> <host> <OID>
	<OID> - allows you to specify an OID to select a certain MIB, object, or instance
