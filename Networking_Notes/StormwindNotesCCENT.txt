################# Section 1 Part 1 ################
#### Router V.S. Switch ####
Router:  
    * used for connecting networks together
    * typically has far fewer ports than a switch 
    * can perform many functions, wifi, connecting to internet, etc. 
    * Typically function in layer 2 of the OSI model 
        = Multilayer routers may function in mutliple layers 

Switch:
    * Used for connecting many devices together 
    * has alot of ports, 24, 48, etc. 
    * Switches are usually layer 2
        = There are switches that go layer 2 & layer 3 called ~multilayer switches~

    NOTE: This exam does not focus on multilayer routers/switches

#### Physical V.S. Logical Topology ####
Physical Topology:
    * physical layout of cables and devices 
    * 3 main topologies
        = ~bus topology~
            @ rarely used 
            @ when HUBs were used instead of switches 
        = ~star topology~
            @ most common 
            @ multiple devices connected to a switch 
        = ~mesh topology~
            @ multiple connections between devices 
            @ good for high availability needs 
            @ good for redundancy 
            @ Expensive 
    * core
        = used when you have tons of connections 
        = expensive but less expensive for large networks 
        = scalable 

Logical Topology:
    * the logical connection of devices 
    * devices may go through different VLANs so it is different than the physical toplogy 


#### Firewalls ####
Firewalls:
    * Firewalls provide security by limiting traffic flow 
    * some traffic is permitted by default because it comes from more trusted interfaces

#### Wireless Access Points and Controllers ####
Access Points (AP):
    * Standalone APs do not use a controller 
        = Manage APs individually 
        = Traffic flows from end user to AP to end user 
    * Lightweight APs require a ~WLC ~(Wireless Lan Controller)~
        = Managed from a central location (WLC)~
        = Traffic flows from end user to AP to WLC to AP to end user  

#### Standards Based Models ####
Standards Based Models:
    * The standardization among models 
    * allows compatibility between different devices 
        = e.g. an iphone can communicate with an android through AT&T or Verizon
        = e.g. firefox and chrome can both access websites 
    * standardized components 
    * reduces complexity 

#### OSI Model ####!
Layer 7 - Application 
Layer 6 - Presentation 
Layer 5 - Session 
Layer 4 - Transport 
Layer 3 - Network 
Layer 2 - Data Link 
Layer 1 - Physical

#### TCP/IP Stack ####!
~Application:
    * Application, Layer 7
    * Presentation, Layer 6
    * Session, Layer 5
~Transport: 
    * Transport, Layer 4
    * data is called ~segments~
~Internet:
    * Network, Layer 3
    * data is called ~packets~
~Link:
    * Data Link, Layer 2
    * Physical, Layer 1
    * data is called ~frames~ or ~bits~ at the physical layer 

############################### Layer 1 - Physical Layer ####################################
#### Encapsulation and De-Encapsulating ####
Computer sends data:
    * starts at app layer -> transport layer -> internet layer -> Link Layer 
    * this is call encapsulation~

Other computer receives data:
    * Link Layer -> internet layer -> transport layer -> app layer 
    * this is called ~de-encapsulation~

#### Layer 1 - Copper ####
Copper:
    * connections are made through ethernet  
    * unshielded twisted pair cable
        = most commonly used 
        = 8 wires in pairs of 2 which are twisted together 
        = least expensive 
    * shielded twisted pair cable 
        = prevents electromagnetic interference 
        = wires wrapped in tin foil stuff 
    * standard used to be that the copper cable length was 100m or 328 feet long 

Types of Copper:
    * CAT 5
        = 100Mbps for 100 meter cable 
    * CAT 5e
        = 1Gbps for 100 meter cable 
    * CAT 6
        = 1Gbps for 100 meter cable 
        = 10Gbps for 55 meter cable
        
Ethernet Cable:
    * Used for copper twisted-pair cabling 
    * Has RJ-45~ connector (same as telephone)

Ehternet Two wiring standards:
    * The standard for what each wire does on the ethernet cable 
    * Think of it as one end connector on the ethernet
    * NOTE: We need two different standards so that we may have ~crossover cabling~      
    * T-568A            
    * T-568B
    * ~Straight-through cabling~ is when T-568A goes to T-568A or T-568B goes to T-568B
        = Used 
    * ~Crossover cabling~ is when a T-568A goes to T-568B or vice versa 
        = We use crossover-cabling when we need to connect the transmit wire to the receive wire 
        = For example a phone microphone goes to a different phones speaker (sender to receiver)
            @ we dont do straight-through cabling here because microphone to microphone connection doesn't make sense 
        = Used for switch-to-switch connections 
        = NOTE: Newer devices are capable of autodetecting what is really going on making straight-through and crossover cabling both work 
    * General Rule:
        = use ~straight-through cabling when connecting ~unlike devices together!
        = use ~crossover cabling when connecting like~ devices together!


#### Layer 1 - Fiber ####
Types of fiber:
    * Multimode Fiber (MMF)
        @ Uses LED 
        @ lower bandwidth
        @ less expensive than single-mode fiber 
    * Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)
        @ Uses Lasers
        @ Used for long distance (miles)

############################## Layer 2 - Data Link Layer ##################################
This layer is in charge of the intelligence needed to convert data to and from the physical layer 
Important Layer 2 operations:
    * Frame Encapsulation
    * Switching aka Frame Forwarding 
    * Media conetention
    * MAC Addresses 

Major layer 2 protocols:
    * LAN 
    * WLAN
    * WAN 

#### Layer 2 - Ethernet Frame ####
Ethernet Frame:
    * 8 bit ~premable
        = used to make aware that a frame is coming in 
    * 6 byte ~desination address~
        = who we are trying to reach    
    * 6 byte ~source address~ 
        = who is sending the data 
    * 2 byte ~type 
        = type of data so we know where to send it 
    * 46-1500 bytes ~data
        = contains a range such as ~46-1500 bytes~ which is the min/max data for each frame 
    * 4 bytes ~FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
        = calculation performed by sending devices
        = receiving device performs calculation as well, if same number retrieved then we know the frame hasn't been modified or damaged 
        = makes sure we dont receive corrupted frames 

#### Layer 2 - Addresses ####
MAC addresses uniquiely identify devices at layer 2
Switches use MACs to forward frames 
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
    * Takes a layer 3 address and finds the layer 2 addresses associated with it 
    * Who is 172.16.3.2 ? -> ARP -> Thats me! Here is my MAC address ->
    * ARP uses the Layer 2 broadcast address of ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff!
    * ARP broadcast "Who has the mac address for IP 172.168.1.1?" -> *gets MAC address* -> ARP replies "Here is the MAC Address"

    * We do not need to ARP every time we need to speak to another device
        = We can store MAC addresses of previously communicated devices within the ~ARP Cache~

MAC Address Formats:
    * CISCO
        = 0000.0c43.2e09
        = Hexadecimal (4 bits each char)

    * Linux
        = 00:00:0c:43:2e:08
    
    * Microsoft
        = 00-00-0C-43-2E-08

    * OUI (Organization Unique Identifier)
        = The first 6 digits of a MAC address uniquely identify an Organization
    * Vendor
        = The last 6 digits of a MAC address 

    * example
        = [OUI]    [Vendor]
        = [00:00:0][C-43-2E-08]


NOTE: MAC Addresses do not have to be unique accross the world 
MAC address only have to be unique among a LAN, VLAN, etc. 
    
###################### Layer 3 - Networking Layer #########################
Important layer 3 operations:
    * Packet encapsulation
    * Routing or packet switching 
    * IP Addressing 

Major Layer 3 protocols:
    * IPv4
        = Globally uniquely identify devices
    * IPv6

##### Packet Structure! #####
Fits within the Frame~:
    * max size of a packet is 1500 bytes 

Version:
    * Determines if IPv4 or IPv6 

Service Type!:
    * DSCP
    * Allows us to differentiate different types of traffic 
        = some traffic is more important than others hence we give some traffic precedence over others 
        = This is possible due to knowing the service type of the packet 

Total Length:
    
TTL (Time To Live):
    * Maximum lifespan of the packet (when the packet will expire)
    * A hop count of how many routers the packet hops through 
    * Prevents the packet from living forever
    * When TTL expires, router sends to PC message through ICMP "TTL exceded message"

Protocol:
    * Helps identify what is going on at the transport layer (TCP or UDP)


Checksum:
    * Used to ensure the data is not corrupted (just like the FCS in layer 2)

Source Address:

Destination Address:

!!!! Must know Source Address, Destination Address, Protocol, and DSCP for exam !!!!


###################### Layer 4 - Transport Layer #########################
Important layer 4 operations:
    * segment~ encapsulation
    * Reliability/Acknowledgements (optional)
    * Flow control 
    * Connection oriented 
    * Application layer identification 

Important Layer 4 protocols:
    * TCP 
    * UDP 

NOTE: Transport layer in TCP/IP stack is the same as the transport layer in the OSI model
