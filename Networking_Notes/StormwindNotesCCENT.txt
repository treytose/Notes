#### Router V.S. Switch ####
Router:  
    * used for connecting networks together
    * typically has far fewer ports than a switch 
    * can perform many functions, wifi, connecting to internet, etc. 
    * Typically function in layer 2 of the OSI model 
        = Multilayer routers may function in mutliple layers 

Switch:
    * Used for connecting many devices together 
    * has alot of ports, 24, 48, etc. 
    * Switches are usually layer 2
        = There are switches that go layer 2 & layer 3 called ~multilayer switches~

    NOTE: This exam does not focus on multilayer routers/switches

#### Physical V.S. Logical Topology ####
Physical Topology:
    * physical layout of cables and devices 
    * 3 main topologies
        = ~bus topology~
            @ rarely used 
            @ when HUBs were used instead of switches 
        = ~star topology~
            @ most common 
            @ multiple devices connected to a switch 
        = ~mesh topology~
            @ multiple connections between devices 
            @ good for high availability needs 
            @ good for redundancy 
            @ Expensive 
    * core
        = used when you have tons of connections 
        = expensive but less expensive for large networks 
        = scalable 

Logical Topology:
    * the logical connection of devices 
    * devices may go through different VLANs so it is different than the physical toplogy 


#### Firewalls ####
Firewalls:
    * Firewalls provide security by limiting traffic flow 
    * some traffic is permitted by default because it comes from more trusted interfaces

#### Wireless Access Points and Controllers ####
Access Points (AP):
    * Standalone APs do not use a controller 
        = Manage APs individually 
        = Traffic flows from end user to AP to end user 
    * Lightweight APs require a ~WLC ~(Wireless Lan Controller)~
        = Managed from a central location (WLC)~
        = Traffic flows from end user to AP to WLC to AP to end user  

#### Standards Based Models ####
Standards Based Models:
    * The standardization among models 
    * allows compatibility between different devices 
        = e.g. an iphone can communicate with an android through AT&T or Verizon
        = e.g. firefox and chrome can both access websites 
    * standardized components 
    * reduces complexity 

#### OSI Model ####
Layer 7 - Application 
Layer 6 - Presentation 
Layer 5 - Session 
Layer 4 - Transport 
Layer 3 - Network 
Layer 2 - Data Link 
Layer 1 - Physical

#### TCP/IP Stack ####
~Application:
    * Application, Layer 7
    * Presentation, Layer 6
    * Session, Layer 5
~Transport: 
    * Transport, Layer 4
~Internet:
    * Network, Layer 3
~Link:
    * Data Link, Layer 2
    * Physical, Layer 1
