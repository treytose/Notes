____ Lean Production Pipeline _____
Basically, create an end product as fast as possible and then redo it better each time until its perfect.
This way you can tell what works and what doesn't early on instead of wasting time trying to get a perfect model the first time just to find out you have to change something.


____ Adding Reference Images _____
Just drag an Image onto blender
OR
Open 'Properties Panel' (Hotkey N) -> Check background images -> expand Background Images -> Add Image

To view the reference image: go to Orthographic camera view (hotkey numpad 5) -> view from a side angle (numpad 1 or other)

TIP: If you are having trouble with the image check the Image options in the Properties Panel under Background Images ***

____ Scaling appropriately ____
Add in a cube and scale its radius appropriately. If your object is 10cm wide make the cubes radius 5cm
Scale your image down to fit inside your cube

____ Bezier Curves ____
Step 1: Shift + a > curves > bezier curve
Step 2: On the left toolbar select 'Align to View' this makes it so its not 3D and only curves the way your orthographic camera is set in the XZ axis
Step 3: Reset bezier curve position > push forward or back your block in Y direction until the curve is visible
Step 4: Press tab to enter edit mode > Select Globval on the properties pane under transform. This is so the Y position is not changed when moving the curve around
Step 5: Right click an endpoint and drag to move it around
Step 6: You can add more to the curve by selecting an endpoint then > ctrl + left click
Step 7: Move the curve around your object only creating new vertex points at tangent slope = 0 points. and then move the red lines accordingly (should look like a tanget line)

____ Creating the curve into a mesh object ____

Ctrl + C > Create mesh from curve
On left toolbar > Keep Original Checked (just incase)

____ Rotational Curving ____
Left side tab > Tools > Spin

Probably looks weird. Mess with the Axis, Angle, and steps on the left toolbar. Center should probably all be 0


____ Adding Materials ____
Right Panel > Materials Tab (BMW looking Icon) > Plus sign (creates a slot for a new material on the selected object)
> add new > select the color > go to edit mode > select the parts of the object you want to color > right panel > assign


____ Smoothing the "Blocky look" _____
NOT in edit mode > left tab tools > Shading: Smooth

____ Exporting Models With Materials ____
File > Save As > etc.
