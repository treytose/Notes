---- Using an Image as a Texture ---- (brick texture on a cube)
In a new Blender File.

- Make sure the object already has a material
- With the object selected, click the textures button on the right panel (next to materials)
- Select a texture slot from the list
- rename the texture
- set the texture 'type' to 'Image or Movie'
- (Optional) View the object in 'Rendered' view to see the texture already applied
- (Possible) In the textures tab, under 'Mapping' select the 'Projection' type. Cube, Flat, Sphere, etc.



--------- Precedural Textures ---------
You can add alot of filters to the texture with the different 'types' mentioned above
